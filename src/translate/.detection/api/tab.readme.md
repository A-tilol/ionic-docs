# ion-tab

The tab component is a child component of [tabs](../tabs). Each tab can contain a top level navigation stack for an app or a single view. An app can have many tabs, all with their own independent navigation.

> Note: This component should only be used with vanilla or Stencil JavaScript projects. For Angular, React, and Vue apps you do not need to use `ion-tab` to declare your tab components.

See the [tabs documentation](../tabs/) for more details on configuring tabs.
